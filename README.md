# python-challenge

These challenge assignments require scripting through Python without additional libraries to analyze two data sets:
  PyBank analyzes the monthly profts and losses of a company, outputing a summary of that data.
  PyPoll analyzes the election results for a small town, outputting the candidate vote totals and winner of the election.
